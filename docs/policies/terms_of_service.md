# Cambigo Terms of Service

_Last updated: 2025-10-08_

These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a binding agreement between you and Informatics FYI, Inc. ("Cambigo", "we", "us", or "our") that governs your access to and use of the Cambigo application, APIs, documentation, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority where you live) and have the authority to accept these Terms on behalf of yourself or the organization you represent. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service complies with all laws and regulations that apply to you.

## 2. Account Registration and Security
The Service uses Clerk to provide authentication. You must provide accurate and complete registration information and keep it up to date. You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials, configuring multi-factor authentication where available, and notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. Cambigo is not liable for losses caused by your failure to secure your account.

## 3. Service Description
Cambigo helps teams capture, organize, and share operational flows and related insights. Core features include:
- Creating and editing flows composed of nodes, groups, items, notes, and metadata
- Sharing flows through revocable tokens with configurable expiration and view limits
- Tracking audit events, change history, and automated tasks that support collaboration

We continually improve the Service and may add, modify, or remove features at any time. When we make material changes, we will provide notice where required.

## 4. Beta, Preview, and Experimental Features
Some functionality, including early-access to the system, may be labeled beta, preview, or experimental. Such features are provided "as is," may be subject to additional terms, and can change or end at any time. You assume all risk when using beta features, and it is recommended to download your flow documents as a backup.

## 5. Your Content
"Content" includes flows, metadata, files, annotations, agent tasks, and any other data you submit to the Service.
- You retain all rights to your Content.
- You grant Cambigo a worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, modify, and display your Content solely as needed to operate, support, and improve the Service, comply with law, and provide requested integrations.
- You represent that you have all necessary rights to submit the Content and that it does not violate these Terms or any applicable law.

## 6. Sharing Features and Responsibilities
When you generate a sharing link, anyone with the link can access the associated flow until you revoke the token, it expires, or view limits are reached. You are responsible for:
- Selecting appropriate expiration periods and view limits
- Revoking tokens that should no longer grant access
- Ensuring shared Content does not disclose confidential or regulated data without proper authorization
- Controlling who receives the links permitting access to the flow document

Cambigo may monitor sharing usage to enforce security, audit events, and feature limits.

## 7. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or create derivative works based on the Service except as allowed by applicable law
- Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service, including attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems or data
- Upload malicious code or use the Service to transmit spam, phishing, or other harmful content
- Misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity or use the Service in violation of third-party rights
- Use the Service to process data subject to heightened legal protections (such as protected health information or government-classified data) unless you have obtained our prior written approval

## 8. Subscription Plans and Trials
Cambigo may offer early-adopter plans, trials, or paid subscriptions. We will present applicable pricing, billing intervals, renewal terms, and cancellation options when you choose a plan. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law. You remain responsible for any taxes associated with your purchase.

## 9. Third-Party Services
The Service integrates with third-party providers, including Clerk for identity, Vercel for hosting and analytics, and other deployment targets such as Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, or Fly.io for related Services and Data Storage. Use of those services is subject to their respective terms. Cambigo is not responsible for third-party services we do not control.

## 10. Feedback
If you send us comments, ideas, or suggestions, you grant Cambigo a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use that feedback for any purpose without obligation to you.

## 11. Privacy
Our processing of personal information is described in the Cambigo Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms. By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your information as outlined in that policy.

## 12. Suspension and Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you violate these Terms, pose a security risk, fail to pay fees when due, or if required by law. You may terminate these Terms by closing your account and ceasing all use of the Service. Upon termination, we may delete or restrict access to your Content, subject to applicable law and our retention obligations.  We may make changes to the Service offerings as Cambigo develops as a product, with no requirement to maintain Services from version to version.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Alabama in which Informatics FYI, Inc. is incorporated, without regard to conflict of law principles. The parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in that jurisdiction, and you waive any objection to venue in those courts. Nothing in this section limits Cambigo’s ability to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

## 17. Changes to the Terms
We may update these Terms to reflect new features, legal requirements, or business needs. If we make material changes, we will notify through the Service website before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 18. General
If any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force. You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our prior written consent. Cambigo may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any additional agreements you accept, constitute the entire agreement between you and Cambigo regarding the Service.
