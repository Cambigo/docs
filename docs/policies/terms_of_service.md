Agreement to Terms
By accessing and using Cambigo Flow ("the Application"), you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service.

Description of Service
Cambigo Flow is a client-side workflow management application that allows users to create, edit, and manage workflows locally in their web browser. The application:

• Operates entirely in your web browser

• Stores all data locally on your device

• Requires account registration for access to the user interface

• Does not transmit your workflow data to external servers

Use License
Permission is granted to temporarily use Cambigo Flow for personal and commercial purposes. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

• Modify or copy the application materials

• Attempt to reverse engineer any software contained in the application

• Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials

User Responsibilities
As a user of Cambigo Flow, you are responsible for:

• Maintaining the security of your device and browser

• Backing up your workflow data as needed

• Using the application in compliance with applicable laws

• Not using the application for any illegal or unauthorized purpose

• Understanding that data is stored locally and may be lost if browser data is cleared

Data and Privacy
All workflow data created and stored in Cambigo Flow remains on your local device. We do not collect, store, or have access to your workflow data. You retain full ownership and control of all content you create using the application. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for detailed information about data handling.

Disclaimer
The materials in Cambigo Flow are provided on an 'as is' basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

Limitations
In no event shall Cambigo or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use Cambigo Flow, even if Cambigo or a Cambigo authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

Accuracy of Materials
The materials appearing in Cambigo Flow could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. We do not warrant that any of the materials are accurate, complete, or current. We may make changes to the materials at any time without notice.

Modifications
We may revise these terms of service at any time without notice. By using Cambigo Flow, you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.

Termination
You may terminate your use of Cambigo Flow at any time by simply stopping use of the application and clearing your browser's local storage. These terms remain in effect until terminated by either party.

Governing Law
These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable local laws, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that state or location.

If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us through our support channels available in the application.
