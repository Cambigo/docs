# Cambigo Cookie Policy

_Last updated: 2025-10-08_

This Cookie Policy explains how Informatics FYI, Inc. ("Cambigo", "we", "us") uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit or use the Cambigo application and related services (the "Service"). Please read this policy together with our Privacy Policy.

## What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored on your device by a website or application. They may be session cookies (deleted when you close your browser) or persistent cookies (stored until they expire or are deleted). We also use local storage and similar technologies to remember your settings.

## Cookies and Technologies We Use

### Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are required for the Service to function.
- **Clerk authentication cookies** maintain your signed-in session, tie browser requests to your Clerk account, and support security features such as multi-factor prompts.
- **Security and throttling cookies** help prevent abuse, enforce view limits, and support audit logging when you access sharing links.

Because these cookies are essential, you cannot opt out of them while using the Service.

### Analytics and Performance Cookies
We use Vercel Analytics to understand aggregate usage of Cambigo, diagnose performance issues, and prioritize improvements. Vercel Analytics may set first-party cookies or rely on other storage methods to count visits and feature interactions. The data is used in aggregate form and is not sold.

### Preferences and Local Storage
Cambigo may store preferences (such as theme selection, UI layouts, or recent flow context) in local storage or similar browser APIs. You can delete these values at any time through your browser settings without affecting critical functionality, although doing so may reset your preferences and any unsynchronized flow documents.

## Managing Cookies
Most browsers allow you to:
- View the cookies stored on your device
- Block cookies from specific sites
- Delete cookies and local storage data

If you disable essential cookies, the Service may not function correctly and you may be unable to sign in. You can disable analytics cookies by using the controls provided in your browser or opt-out mechanisms that Vercel offers (if available for your region).

## Updates to This Policy
We may update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in the cookies we use or to comply with legal requirements. The "Last updated" date above will change when we make revisions. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
