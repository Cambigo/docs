What Are Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to website owners about user preferences and behavior.

How Cambigo Uses Cookies and Local Storage
Cambigo Flow is designed to operate primarily using your browser's local storage rather than traditional cookies. Our approach to data storage includes:

• Local Storage: We use browser local storage to save your workflow data, preferences, and application settings directly on your device.

• Essential Cookies: We may use essential cookies that are necessary for the basic functionality of the application, such as maintaining your session state.

• No Tracking Cookies: We do not use cookies for tracking, analytics, or advertising purposes.

Types of Cookies We Use
Essential Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the application to function properly and cannot be disabled:

• Application state management

• User interface preferences (theme, layout settings)

• Session management for application functionality

Functional Cookies
These cookies enhance your experience by remembering your choices:

• Language preferences

• Display settings

• Recently accessed workflows

What We Don't Use
Cambigo Flow does not use:

• Analytics cookies

• Advertising cookies

• Social media tracking cookies

• Third-party tracking technologies

• Cross-site tracking mechanisms

Managing Cookies and Local Storage
You have control over cookies and local storage in several ways:

Browser Settings
Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can:

• Block all cookies

• Delete existing cookies

• Set preferences for specific websites

• Receive notifications when cookies are set

Local Storage Management
You can clear local storage data through your browser's developer tools or by clearing your browsing data. Note that clearing local storage will remove all your Cambigo workflow data.

Impact of Disabling Cookies
While you can disable cookies in your browser, doing so may affect the functionality of Cambigo Flow. Essential cookies are required for the application to work properly. Disabling these may result in:

• Loss of application settings

• Inability to save preferences

• Reduced functionality or performance

Data Retention
Essential cookies are typically session-based and are removed when you close your browser. Functional cookies and local storage data persist until you manually delete them or clear your browser data.

Updates to This Policy
We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised "Last updated" date.

If you have any questions about our use of cookies or this Cookie Policy, please contact us through our support channels available in the application.
