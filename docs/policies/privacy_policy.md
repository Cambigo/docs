# Cambigo Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-10-08_

Informatics FYI, Inc. ("Cambigo", "we", "us" or "our") operates the Cambigo application and related services (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you access or use the Service. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the Service.

## Quick Summary
- We use Clerk to create and manage user accounts; Clerk processes your sign-in credentials and profile information on our behalf.
- Flow content, metadata, sharing tokens, agent tasks, and related materials that you upload are stored in our managed databases.
- We collect security and diagnostic data (including IP addresses, user agents, audit events, and Vercel Analytics metrics) to operate, secure, and improve Cambigo.
- You control whether a flow is shared externally. Sharing tokens include expiration and view limits that you manage, otherwise, flow documents are limited to your account.
- Contact support@cambigo.com to exercise privacy rights, request deletion, or ask questions.

## Information We Collect

### Account and Authentication Data
We rely on Clerk (https://clerk.com) to register and authenticate users. When you create or access an account, Clerk collects information such as your name, email address, profile image, and authentication factors (for example, passwords or multi-factor tokens). Clerk stores this information and shares relevant account identifiers with us so that we can provide the Service. We do not store your password.

### Workspace and Flow Content
When you create, import, or update flows, we store the nodes, groups, items, metadata, comments, tags, and other structured information that you submit. If you attach descriptions, labels, or other context, those details are saved as part of the flow record. Flows are associated with your Clerk user ID so that we can present your workspace and sync changes across sessions.

### Sharing Tokens and Collaboration Settings
If you generate a public or restricted sharing link, we create a sharing token containing the share ID, expiration settings, view limits, revocation flags, and optional description. We record how many times the link has been accessed so that we can enforce the limits you set.

### Agent and MCP Task Data
***(Future Implementation)*** When you use Cambigo agent features or the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations to communicate with your generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) providers (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Gemini, etc.), we may store task definitions, execution notes, personas, and update logs tied to the relevant flow. This data helps coordinate automated assistance and track progress.

### Diagnostic, Usage, and Analytics Data

- **Audit logs:** Our audit logger records access events, including your Clerk user ID (if authenticated), request identifiers, timestamps, IP address, and user agent. These records support security monitoring and troubleshooting.

- **Service analytics:** We use Vercel Analytics to capture aggregate usage metrics (for example page views, feature adoption, and performance indicators). Vercel may collect IP addresses, device identifiers, and browser information to deliver this service.

- **Application logs:** We log error messages, status codes, and contextual metadata when the Service encounters issues.

### Support and Communications
If you contact us by email or other channels, we collect the information you provide and any follow-up communications so that we can respond to your request.

## How We Use Information
We process personal data for the following purposes:
- Provide, operate, and maintain the Cambigo workspace and collaboration features
- Authenticate users and secure access to flows and sharing links
- Store and sync flow content, sharing tokens, and agent task configurations
- Enforce feature limits, revocations, and expiration policies that you configure
- Monitor for abuse, detect security threats, and investigate incidents
- Analyze anonymized and aggregated usage patterns to improve performance and usability
- Communicate with you about updates, support requests, and administrative notices
- Comply with applicable law, legal process, or enforceable government requests

## Legal Bases (Users Outside the United States)

All data resides on servers within the United States of America.  We may expand this in the future, but we do not anticipate a timeframe for this during the initial rollout.  If you are located in a Country with specific requirements, you may contact us at the support email below with your questions.

## How We Share Information
We share information in the limited circumstances described below:

- **Service providers:** We work with trusted vendors to host and operate Cambigo. This includes Vercel (application hosting and analytics), Clerk (identity management), managed  database and infrastructure partners that include Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, and/or Fly.io. These partners are bound by contractual obligations to protect your data and may only use it to provide services to us.

- **Legal compliance:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests.

- **Business transfers:** If Cambigo engages in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to this policy.

- **With your direction:** When you create sharing links or export content, anyone with the resulting link or file can view the shared material until you revoke access or the token expires.

We do not sell personal information.

## Retention
We retain account data for as long as your account remains active. Flow content, sharing tokens, and agent task data are stored until you delete them or close your account, subject to our backup and legal requirements. You are able to download your flows in a variety of person-readable documents, and a machine-readable JSON document. 

Revoked or expired sharing tokens are marked inactive but may remain in our logs for auditing purposes. Audit logs and analytics data are retained for as long as necessary to investigate incidents, improve the Service, and comply with legal obligations.

## Security
We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. These measures include authenticated API access, audit logging, encryption in transit, input validation, rate limiting, and automated alerts for unusual activity. No system can be guaranteed 100% secure, and you remain responsible for choosing strong credentials, safeguarding sharing links, and revoking tokens that should no longer be active.

We do not support your storage of Personally Identifiable Information or other regulated information such as Protected Health Information.  If you require such services, contact us directly at the support contact below before you use Cambigo for these purposes.

Our managed database provider does encrypt data in transit and at rest, and the Cambigo application only supports HTTPS in browsers.

## International Transfers
Our infrastructure and service providers may process or store information in the United States and other jurisdictions. When we transfer personal data internationally, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as contractual clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms at the provider.

## Your Rights and Choices
Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict how we use your personal data. You can:
- Manage flow content, revoke sharing links, or delete flows from within the app
- Update your profile and authentication details through Clerk’s account settings
- Request account deletion, data export, or additional privacy assistance by emailing support@cambigo.com

We will respond to verified requests in accordance with applicable law.

## Children’s Privacy
Cambigo is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact support@cambigo.com so we can take appropriate action.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features, legal requirements, or operational changes. When we make material updates, we will revise the “Last updated” date and notify you through the Service or by email where required.
